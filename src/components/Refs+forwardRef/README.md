### How to use refs

##### it is basically assigning a refernece of a element to varibale so that we can access it and do wtever we like .

##### in this folder both fucnitonal and statefull refs are used with example

### These provides us the refernce `directly` but what when we need the refenrce of the inner nested element ? here comes the conxept of `forward refs`

so ```forward ref``` lets us get the node of the nested element (i.e nested component i.e of any component)


## We also learned in it how we make focus on a particcular text field

```NOte``` : ek refrnce bnao ,variable me save kro or usy agy as a prop pass krdo jiska bhi tmy refrnce node chiye
